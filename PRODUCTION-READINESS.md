## Final Verification Steps

Before publishing to npm, complete these final steps:

1. **Clean Build**

   ```bash
   rm -rf dist/
   npx nx build nx-astro
   ```

2. **Verify Build Output**

   ```bash
   ls -la dist/nx-astro/
   cat dist/nx-astro/package.json
   ```

3. **Run All Tests**

   ```bash
   npx nx test nx-astro
   npx nx lint nx-astro
   npx nx e2e nx-astro-e2e
   ```

4. **Test Package Locally**

   ```bash
   cd dist/nx-astro
   npm pack
   # Install in test project
   cd /path/to/test-project
   npm install /path/to/nx-astro-0.1.0.tgz
   ```

5. **Verify Installed Package**
   ```bash
   npx nx g nx-astro:init
   npx nx g nx-astro:app test-app
   npx nx build test-app
   ```

## Known Limitations

Document any known limitations or edge cases:

1. **E2E Tests** - Require local npm registry setup (verdaccio)
2. **Astro Versions** - Currently targets Astro 5.0.3+
3. **Node.js Versions** - Requires Node.js 18.17.0 or higher
4. **Package Managers** - Tested with pnpm, npm, and yarn
